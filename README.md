# OlimAutoSender
A little Max4live device to send audio signal to Ableton Live return tracks  automatically while playing a MIDI keyboard above a user defined trashold.

While preparing my liveset for my new forthcoming project Olim, I did this very simple midi device, useful to play with a keyboard and automatically trigger delay or whatever you want to put on a return. 
You can set a MIDIVelocity-IN threshold and select where to send the the signal and the amount to send. 
If you add more return tracks you can use a button to automatically update the list of available returns within the device.
