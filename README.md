# OlimAutoSender
A little Max4live device to send audio signal to Ableton Live return tracks  automatically while playing a MIDI keyboard above a user defined trashold.

# Intro
While preparing my liveset for my new forthcoming project Olim https://soundcloud.com/olimproject, I did this very simple midi device, useful to play with a keyboard and automatically trigger delay or whatever you want to put on a return. 
You can set a MIDIVelocity-IN threshold and select where to send the signal and the amount to send. 
If you add more return tracks you can use a button to automatically update the list of available returns within the device. 

# Installation and usage
Download or git clone the device in MAX MIDI EFFECTS FOLDER under your Ableton Live User Libray > Preset > MIDI EFFECTS.
Drop the device on any MIDI track within Live, Enjoy!

# Improvements 
In my opinion this max device could be improved in 2 ways (feel free to contribute to this or submit any other cool ideas):
- At the moment if you add a return track you need to hit a button to update the list, would be nice if the list is automatically updated without the user interaction.
- At the moment you can send the signal to just one return track. The device should be able to have multiple assignment and individual amount and treshold, so you could be able to send to different return tracks or to all at once based on your gestures and pressure on the keyboard :)
